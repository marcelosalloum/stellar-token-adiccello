/// capability to mint tokens. This trait is designed to be used in conjunction
/// with the `FungibleToken` trait.
///
/// Excluding the `mint` functionality from the `[FungibleToken]` trait
/// is a deliberate design choice to accommodate flexibility and customization
/// for various smart contract use cases.
