/// Vanilla Fungible Token Trait
///
/// The `FungibleToken` trait defines the core functionality for fungible
/// tokens, adhering to SEP-41. It provides a standard interface for managing
/// balances, allowances, and metadata associated with fungible tokens.
/// Additionally, this trait includes the `total_supply()` function, which is
/// not part of SEP-41 but is commonly used in token contracts.
///
/// To fully comply with the SEP-41 specification one have to implement the
/// `Burnable` trait in addition to this one. SEP-41 mandates support for token
/// burning to be considered compliant.
